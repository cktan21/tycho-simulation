# Static Data Ingestor

allows you to take in static JSON data and ingest it
basic idea is that the data is being queried and stored based on that state => this is finding a way to manually load a state

## How to run

```bash
# Run the price_printer example with a TVL threshold of 1000
cargo run --release --example price_printer -- --tvl-threshold 1000
```
